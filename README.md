# Nginx
Starting nginx on windows is simple, just go to the nginx root folder, double click on the nginx.exe file
And then open your website and type:
localshost
(keep in mind that it's not localhost:8080 or localhost:8081 or sth like that)
Then you are told:
If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and working. Further configuration is required.
