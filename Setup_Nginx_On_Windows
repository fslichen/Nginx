First of all, go to the conf folder of nginx.
Create a backup for nginx.conf
Then make the following changes:
location / {
  root "D:/Buffer";
}
Keep in mind not to touch any other changes.
Then fire up the task manager, terminate the current running nginx instance.
Then go to the nginx folder and then double click on nginx.exe
Go back to the task manager, you should be able to see two nginx instances 
running at the same time. 
Go to your local drive, and create the folder structure like the following:
Buffer
 -html
  hello.html
 -image
  cat.png
 index.html
Then open your browser, test the following links:
http://localhost
http://localhost/image/cat.png
http://localhost/html/hello.html
You'll find that the loading speed is super fast.
